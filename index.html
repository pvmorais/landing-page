He knows that with hard work, determination and a never-give-up attitude, anything is possible. He encourages others to not be afraid of taking risks to get the best reward, and to never give up on their dreams. The world is waiting for them to make their mark, and together with his friends, Ash believes they can achieve anything. Success is just a step away, so he continues to push forward and encourages others to do the same."
